    "\n",
    "At this point you should be ready to query Media Cloud for data. You can use boolean query syntax - [read our query guide](https://mediacloud.org/support/query-guide) for more details about the exact syntax (it runs a [SOLR search](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/the-standard-query-parser.html#the-standard-query-parser) under the hood). **This notebook demonstrates how to quickly measure attention paid to an issue by the media**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Studying media attention is critical for understanding how much readers are exposed to an issue, and has a long traditon. Media Cloud supports investigatin attention within individual sources we track, or within collecitons or sources. We have wide global coverage with both national-level and regional/state-level collections for most countries. You can [browse our geographic collections](https://sources.mediacloud.org/#/collections/country-and-state) to see more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary API method to support studying attention is exposed in our Python API as `storyCount`. You can read [the low level documentation](https://github.com/berkmancenter/mediacloud/blob/master/doc/api_2_0_spec/api_2_0_spec.md#apiv2stories_publiccount) for more details about the parameters it supports."
