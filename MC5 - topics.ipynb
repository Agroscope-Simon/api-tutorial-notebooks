    "Media Cloud: Using Topics\n",
    "=========================\n",
    "\n",
    "When you really want to dig into an issue and investigate it more deeply, Media Cloud allows you to make a \"topic\" with Topic Mapper. A topic is a corpus of open web storeis that you can analyze in extended ways. This is useful in three speciic ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Discover More Content** - seed it with the open-web stories we know about, spider from those to discover more; pull in content from other platforms such as Reddit, Google search results, etc\n",
    "* **Measure Influence** - look at networks of linking between stories and sources; analyze social media posting patterns\n",
    "* **Slice and Dice Content** - analyze content by week or month; compare subtopics based on keyword matches, countries or focus, and more\n",
    "\n",
    "The [API for topics](https://github.com/berkmancenter/mediacloud/blob/master/doc/api_2_0_spec/topics_api_2_0_spec.md) is different than the standard API. A few key concepts are described in [the short section on \"Snapshots, Timespans, and Foci\"](https://github.com/berkmancenter/mediacloud/blob/master/doc/api_2_0_spec/topics_api_2_0_spec.md#snapshots-timespans-and-foci) that you sould read:\n",
    "* topics have different versions, so that we can go back to previous versions of a corpus to support reproduceable research (these are called `snapshots` in the API\n",
    "* the time-based, and sub-topic-based slicig and dicing is captured in the idea of `timespans`\n",
    "* if you do not specify a `snapshot` or `timespan`, it will use the latest overall timespan (ie. your overall corpus)\n"
