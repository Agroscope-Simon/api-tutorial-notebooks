    "[Media Cloud](https://mediacloud.org) is an open-source platform for media analysis. It is a collaborative academic project supported by various non-profit foundations since 2011. You can use our various online tools to investigate news coverage about your topic of interest, and all the same information is available via a rich API. We maintain and provide [a Python client for the api on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/mediacloud/)."
