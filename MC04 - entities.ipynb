    "At this point you're ready to query Media Cloud for data. You can use boolean query syntax - [read our query guide](https://mediacloud.org/support/query-guide) for more details about the exact syntax (it runs a [SOLR search](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/the-standard-query-parser.html#the-standard-query-parser) under the hood). **This notebook demonstrates how to quickly evaluate the entities being mentioned**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the entities mentioned in media stories can be very helpful to understand whose narrative is dominating the framing of an issue. Every English-language story in our system is run through our [Cliff-Clavin tool](https://cliff.mediacloud.org), which extracts **people**, **places** and **orginations** mentioned in text (via [Stanford's CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/)). The core add-on is the extra added layer of heuristics that disambiguates the geographic mentions (more details in [our NewsKDD paper from 2014](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/123451)). Sadly this only works in English.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entities are stored as *tags* on stories. Tags are collected into tag sets to support aggregation and comparison. There are 3 tag sets related to entities, all captured as constants in `mediacloud.tags`:\n",
    "* People - tag set 2389 (`mediacloud.tags.TAG_SET_CLIFF_PEOPLE`)\n",
    "* Organizations - tag set 2388 (`mediacloud.tags.TAG_SET_CLIFF_ORGS`)\n",
    "* Places (countries and states/provinces) - tag set 1011 (`mediacloud.tags.TAG_SET_CLIFF_PLACES`)\n",
